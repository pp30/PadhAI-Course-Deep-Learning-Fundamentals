Implementation of fundamental concepts pertaining to Deep Learning.

Includes (Decreasing order of complexity)

1) Vectorized FFNN : Hard-coded vectorized Feed Forward Neural Network using numpy (without Sci-kit, PyTorch model libraries). 
2) Scalar_BackProp : Visualizing learning in a simple Fully Connected (FC) NN with back propagation. 
3) FeedForward NN: Hard-coded version of (1) without vectorization for classification task.
4) Sigmoid Neuron: Hardcoded a forward and back-prop via a single sigmoid neuron - a brick in the NN building :)
5) MP-Neuron/Perceptron: Decision based upon a fixed threshold and simple parametrization.  
6 & 7) Python basics
